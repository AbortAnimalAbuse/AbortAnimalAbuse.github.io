                <blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">The shocking number of animal cruelty cases reported every day is just the tip of the iceberg; most cases are never reported. Unlike violent crimes against people, cases of animal abuse are not compiled by state or federal agencies making it difficult to calculate just how common they are. Animal abuse have different forms, it may be torturing or beating an animal but it also includes animal neglect or failure in providing the needs of an animal under the owner’s custody.</span><br></span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Research finds a clear and compelling link between animal abuse and other violent acts. Animal abuse does not only hurt animals; it affects our entire community. Animal abuse also has a strong connection to domestic violence. Whenever an animal is abused, a chain reaction begins in our community. Not only does an innocent animal get injured, but the person who commits the offense often falls into a cycle that could ultimately result in violence against other people. The evidence of a link between cruelty to animals and violence toward humans is compelling. In the vast majority of cases, cruelty to animals is just one aspect of a social environment marked by violence. In fact, people who abuse animals are five times more likely to commit violent crime.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">One local example of grave cases of human’s cruelty to animals is Wacko. Wacko, a dog who lives in Northern Samar lost its upper snout to a drunken man’s “bolo”. The guy swayed his bolo and the dog got hit on its head resulting to its chopped snout. This case was presented to the House Committee to encourage the officials revise the rules regarding this matter. Although a law is present against these cruel acts, people continue doing so because of lack in authority. One of which is the Republic Act No. 8485, also known as the Animal Welfare Act of 1998 Section 1, with the purpose of protecting and promoting the welfare of all animals in the Philippines by supervising and regulating the establishment and operations of all facilities utilized for breeding, maintaining, keeping, treating or training of all animals either as objects of trade or as household pets. In accordance with this neglected law a new Bill is proposed. House Bill 5849 seeks to put violators of the animal welfare law behind bars for six to 12 years and to increase fine to P10,000 because RA 8485 only imposes six months to two years jail time and fines of only up to P5,000 for offenders.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Harambe the Gorilla is one famous example of animal cruelty. Harambe was contained in Cincinnati Zoo’s gorilla enclosure. The Gorilla’s life ended on May 28, 2016 due to a tragic incident involving a three-year-old boy. A splash was heard and everyone got panicked when an older gentleman yelled that there is a child inside the enclosure. The gorilla was attracted to the screaming and came barreling to the edge of the moat and then realized what’s going on. Harambe approached the child without any trace of aggression, it was as if he was trying to help. Harambe dragged the child further down and everybody started screaming again. A first act of helpfulness ended up in violence. The life of the boy versus the life of the gorilla. Everything is a mess, but the incident still ended up choosing the life of a human that costs the life of Harambe.
</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Animal abuse, like many other forms of abuse, is about power and control over a helpless victim. It is intolerable. By taking action against animal cruelty, we not only prevent animal suffering, but also uncover and perhaps prevent additional crimes. Understand the link and take animal abuse seriously. Hurting an animal hurts us all. Mahatma Gandhi leaves us his message, “The greatest of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way its animals are treated”.
